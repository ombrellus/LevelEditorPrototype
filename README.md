# LevelEditorPrototype
this is a skeleton of a simple level editor for unity that you can use to make your own

you can use this in whatever you want

also sorry for the mess in the project, i made it in 2 (+ 4 for github, getting distracted, adding comments and make it more human-friendly (before it was just in italian and numbers)) hours

i am not that good in descriptions soooooo.... bye
